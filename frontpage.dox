  \section frontpage_about About the stator library

  Stator is a Computer Algebra System (CAS) which focuses on using
  compile-time (template metaprogramming) or runtime stack-allocated
  algorithms. This means it is really, really, fast (zero overhead, or
  even a speed-up thanks to compile-time cancellation of terms, when
  compared to hand coded expressions). Its not as fully featured as a
  full CAS (such as Mathematica) though yet.

  Not convinced? Try the simple example below!

  \dontinclude symbolic_example.cpp
  \skip Quick example
  \until //Output: 0.25

  As everything is performed by the compiler via template
  metaprogramming, only the last substitution can incur any run-time
  cost. In fact, all of the code above has the same computational cost
  as writing:

  \code
  double a = std::sin(2.3*2.3)+2*std::cos(2.3*2.3);
  \endcode

  Most modern compilers will also eliminate the cost of this too,
  leading to zero run-time cost.

  As we have a symbolic representation of the function we can perform
  some interesting transformations of it. Taking the derivative is
  also carried out at compile time:

  \until //Output:
  
  Basic functionality like this also allows more complex operations,
  such as creating a truncated sym::taylor_series:

  \until }//End

  This creates a sym::Polynomial type, which is a std::array of the
  coefficients again at compile time; however, solving for the roots
  for a 5th order polynomial like this one requires iterations thus it
  must be done at run time; however, both are carried out without
  dynamic allocation and thus are very fast on any modern compiler.

  See the \ref symbolic_guide "guide to the symbolic library" for more details on how to use the library.

  \section frontpage_usage Using the stator library

  First, you will need a modern compiler to use stator. In fact, you
  will need a version of GCC >= 6, clang >= 3.6, and MSVC >= 2015 for
  all of the library to work. The MSVC compiler has difficulties with
  deeply templated expressions thus it is not recommended for use with
  this library.

  The current compiler support on Linux is available at the <a
  href="https://travis-ci.org/toastedcrumpets/stator">Travis CI
  page</a>.

  

  Stator is a header-only C++11 library. In many places it builds upon
  the Eigen 3 library (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/), so to use it you
  must have both added to your compiler include path. For example, on
  linux
  
  \code{.unparsed}
  g++ -I /path/to/stator/folder -I /path/to/Eigen/folder
  \endcode

    \page symbolic_guide Guide to stator::sym

    \brief This is a short introduction to the compile-time symbolic algebra library (see symbolic_example.cpp).
    
    To use stator, first include the stator::sym library header file
    and bring the sym namespace into scope for convenience:
  
    \dontinclude symbolic_example.cpp
    \skipline #include <stator
    \until using
    
    \section sym_guide_var Variables

    Variables are a critical component of a CAS system. Each
    variable is a placeholder for a future expression and thus needs
    a unique index to identify it. These are identified in stator
    either using a single character or an index:

    \until v42

    Expressions using variables (and all derived classes of
    sym::SymbolicOperator) are not evaluated immediately, but result
    in symbolic expressions:
     
    \until //Output:
         
    Variables can be substituted for other variables, for example, we can replace \f$x\f$ with \f$y+2\f$:

    \until //Output:

    To evaluate an expression, all variables (and other symbolic
    types) must be substituted for non-symbolic values. A final
    substitution for \f$y=\pi\f$ in the previous expression causes a
    complete evaluation to a double type:

    \until //Output:

    All of this is evaluated at compile time into the basic floating
    point operations, which also may be optimised away, thus complex
    mathematics may be written in a natural way without worrying
    about computational cost.

    \section sym_guide_const Rational constants

    Stator can work with standard arithmetic terms (integers,
    floats); however, they only have limited compile-time symbolic
    support. For example, the following expression cannot be
    simplified by stator:

    \until //Output:

    The difficulty here is that the compiler cannot deduce the value
    of an integer or float from its type (which is all the compiler
    has access to). C++11 gave us std::ratio, which allows rational
    constants to be encoded as a ratio of two integer values. In
    stator, this has been extended to give the rational constant
    type, \ref sym::C. This allows the compiler to perform rational
    arithmetic at compile time:
 
    \until //Output:
  
    When the rational constant type sym::C is used, stator can
    cancel zero terms. For example, any term multiplied by \ref
    sym::Null "C<0>" (which has a convenient typedef of \ref
    sym::Null) is cancelled to zero at compile time:

    \until //Output:

    Equally, any term multiplied by \ref sym::Unity "C<1>" (which has a
    convenient typedef of \ref sym::Unity), is left unchanged:

    \until //Output:
      
    To enable this powerful simplification, \ref sym::C values
    should be used wherever possible.

    \section sym_guide_calculus Calculus, simplification, and other transformations

    As mathematical expressions are encoded as types, the compiler
    can apply transformations to them. For example, the derivative
    can be evaluated at compile-time:

    \until Output

    More complex operations are available, such as Taylor series:

    \until Output

    The output can rapidly become ugly. Fortunately, basic
    simplification is available via sym::simplify. For example:
    
    \until //Output: (x ^ C<5>()) 

    Please note, simplify only exists if there is a simplification
    to be made and will fail at compile time if there is not. You
    can also use sym::try_simplify if you do not want missing
    simplification to be an error.

    The Taylor series expansion above actually has no
    simplification. However, it can be converted into a Polynomial type, which gives a simpler representation and allows further functional analysis.
    
    \section sym_guide_poly Polynomial types

    The sym::expand function attempts to collect the coefficients of
    a polynomial and create a sym::Polynomial type:

    \until Output: P(

    The output here is a sym::Polynomial type (as indicated by the
    "P()" wrapper). The sym::Polynomial is simply an array of
    coefficients, from lowest to highest order:
   
    \until Output: -1.33333

    Most importantly, the polynomial type allows further functional
    analysis, such as determining the roots of the polynomial:

    \until Output: 1.22474

    Here there are three real roots, and they are returned in a \ref
    stator::orphan::StackVector "StackVector", which is like a
    std::vector with a fixed maximum size allowing it to be
    allocated on the stack.

    The library is capable of solving for all of the real roots of
    arbitrary polynomials but relies on numerical iteration schemes
    for polynomials of any order greater than three.
  
    \section vec_sym_guide Vector expressions
  
    The symbolic library also supports Eigen vector/matrix
    expressions.
    
    \until Output
    
    You have to be careful though. Eigen preserves the row/column
    nature of the vectors so operations like multiplication may
    cause compile errors
